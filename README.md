A collection fo all my data set projects with Kaggle!

While I do not intend to put all of my projects in this resposity, my smaller data exploration projects will be attached here, as copies of thier orignal posts on Kaggle. All of the scripting is performed with Python, using the jupiter notebook enviorment,
and various related python libraries.
