A number of things; firstly we find some evidence to my original claim, the US and Japan have a higher proportion than most countries in an expected player per capita, but we find that multiple countries fall into this category! This data implies that speedrunning seems to have a stronger presense in some countries, atleast when examing the top 500, to a rather signigient margin. I do wish to especially highlight Canada here, as it is by far the most overparticpating region, and suprisingly, that South Korea and England both are extreme underperformers. \n\nTo note, this should not be used to make sweeping observations about the skill of runnings in any given category, but rather to highlight the culteral important that might be placed on the activvty. Italian runners remain in the top three for both 1 and 0 star at the time of this writing, implying that even less represented regions should not be ignored.
